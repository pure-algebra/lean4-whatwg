# Gates.Citations

The internal-citation gate: no line-numbered citation into a mutable authored
document of this repository.

A line citation into a pinned vendored source is stable: the bytes are
identified by digest and never edited here. A line citation into one of this
repository's own authored rulings is not stable. Those documents are edited
continuously, so a name plus a line number silently retargets whenever a
section above it grows or shrinks, and the citing sentence keeps asserting a
claim the target no longer makes.

The gate scans every authored text file outside `vendor/`, `.lake/`, and
`.git/` and rejects a token that names a protected document together with a
line number, in either the full-path or the basename spelling followed by a
colon and a digit. Cite a section heading, an obligation ID, a proof-graph
node, or a short quoted phrase instead.

What a pass means: no such token exists in the scanned tree. What a pass does
not mean: that any other citation resolves, or that a target still says what
the citing sentence claims. This is a lexical scan, not a resolver.

/-- Authored documents that may not be cited by line number. Basenames are
matched as well as full paths.

`docs/PROMISE-PACKAGE-PLAN.md` joined the set at slice Q2 (review debt D11,
2026-09-07). The rationale above is that a name plus a line number silently
retargets whenever a section above it grows or shrinks, and that file is the
worst case for it in this repository: the Q1 slice alone gained three receipt
subsections in the middle of the document, one of them through a merge that
kept both sides, and Q2, Q3 and Q4 each append more. It is a lane plan rather
than an authority router, which is the only argument against and a weak one:
the gate is a lexical scan whose cost is one string in this list, and the plan
is cited by the breakers, the builders and the reviewer alike. Whether the
other three package plans and the DAG documents join as a class is the
coordinator's call and is not decided here. -/
