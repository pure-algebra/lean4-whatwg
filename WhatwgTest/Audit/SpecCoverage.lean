# Specification-coverage numerator

`docs/SPEC-COVERAGE.md` owns the metric; this module is its numerator side.
The frozen row list is `WhatwgTest/Audit/SpecCoverageRows.lean`, which
`lake exe census --write` generates alongside
`generated/spec-algorithm-census.tsv` so that a table of several hundred rows (450 at P1.1) is never
transcribed by hand. Both projections are covered by the census gate's
byte-for-byte drift check, so neither can be edited without failing
`lake exe census`.

The generated row list carries one fact per row, its joined disposition, and
gates every row `absent` with no witness. What is authored here is the freeze,
the checks, and the numerator proper: the coverage state of each row that has
left `absent`, the step-by-step justification behind that state, and the
witness theorems with their frozen statements.

## The emit, and why it is Lean data rather than a generated file

`lake exe census --report` prints the coverage block from `emit` below. The
census executable's root, `bin/Census.lean`, imports this module and hands
`emit` to `Gates.Census.cli`; `Gates/` cannot import a test-side module, so
the direction is inverted at the entry point rather than inside the gate.

The alternative the P1 landing left open was a generated projection under
`generated/` written at elaboration. It was rejected: the state and witness
columns of such a file are exactly the columns no `Gates/` code can
recompute, so its drift gate could only ever re-derive the census-owned
columns and the one number the estate quotes would sit on a hand-editable
line. Compiled Lean data cannot drift from the module that declares it, and
the checks below run before the executable that reads it can link. The cost
is recorded in `Gates/AGENTS.md`: `lake exe census --write` now needs this
module to elaborate, so a census change that invalidates the freeze is
repaired here in the same edit.

## What the elaboration-time gate below decides

- the frozen rows and the census projection carry the same ids in the same
  order and the same number of them, and the header agrees with the count;
- every disposition recorded in `census/overrides.tsv` reached its row, and
  every row that file names exists;
- the denominator recomputed from the frozen dispositions matches the frozen
  `expectedDenominator`, using the exclusion rule of `docs/SPEC-COVERAGE.md`;
- every claimed row exists, is claimed once, and is inside the denominator: a
  witness on an excluded row fails the build;
- every step of a claimed row carries at least one justification, and the
  claimed state is the one the step table forces: `green` exactly when no step
  is left to a foreign boundary, `partial` exactly when at least one is;
- every witness names a constant that exists, is a `theorem`, and whose kernel
  receipt is inside the ceiling and equal to the receipt frozen below;
- the witness set, the receipt table, the `StatementSnapshot` list, and the
  `#check (@name : proposition)` ascriptions in this file agree in every
  direction and in the same order; and
- every row that is not claimed is `absent` with no witness, and the three
  expected totals hold.

A row is `green` only when every step or clause of its pinned algorithm text
is a named theorem over the Lean model. Two step kinds are not theorems and
are recorded as such: a step left to a foreign boundary (`DATA-FB-*` of
`docs/DATA-DAG.md`), which forces `partial`; and an `Assert:` step whose
negation the model's typing makes unrepresentable, which is discharged by
construction and leaves nothing to prove. The second reading is a judgment,
disclosed here so it can be overturned in one place: requiring a theorem for
those assertion steps as well would move `op.enqueue-value-with-size`,
`op.dequeue-value`, `op.peek-queue-value` and `op.reset-queue` from `green` to
`partial`, and no other row.

Reading files at elaboration puts this module in `MetaM`, which reaches
`Classical.choice`, so its exact name is listed in
`WhatwgTest/Audit/AxiomGate.lean`'s `auditImplementationModules`. The
section-to-disposition join itself is not recomputed here: it needs the pinned
`index.bs`, and `lake exe census` is the gate that owns it.

/-! ## Statement ascriptions

One `#check (@name : proposition)` per witness, transcribed from `#check @name`
output. A proof that changes its statement fails here before it can move a
coverage state.

Every line below is pretty-printer output rather than an authored binder, so
the unused-variable linter is scoped off for this section and nothing else: a
universally quantified type variable that the proposition reaches only through
another argument's type reads as unused, and renaming it would stop the
transcription being verbatim. Package ruling R-6, warnings as errors, stands
everywhere else in this file. -/
