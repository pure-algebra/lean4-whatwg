# lean4-whatwg

WHATWG standards reified in Lean 4, one library per standard: `Whatwg.Streams`, the Streams Standard; `Whatwg.Infra`, the Infra Standard (pinned, empty); and `Whatwg.Html`, the HTML content model under the HTML Standard's authority, whose schema was bootstrapped from OCaml TyXML's row types and is authored source since 2026-09-06 (`docs/HTML-PACKAGE-PLAN.md`). The Streams library: the specification's
algorithms and internal state as first-order Lean data with proved laws, a
relational semantics over explicit decisions, an EffHOL-style logic layer
above it, and, later, a checked lowering of a closed combinator alphabet to
TypeScript.

The semantic authority is the specification source, `index.bs`, at one pinned
commit. The specification's own reference implementation is second-tier
evidence. Web Platform Tests are the host conformance corpus, replayed against
named host profiles. No host defines the model.

Current state: **P0 bootstrap complete, pre-release.** The package builds, the
Lean-implemented gates run, the pinned sources are sealed, and no semantic
declaration exists yet. Nothing here claims that any stream behaviour has been
modelled or proved.

## Build and gates

The toolchain is pinned by `lean-toolchain` to exactly
`leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`. Two Lake dependencies, each at an exact commit:
`hash` ([lean4-hash](https://github.com/pure-algebra/lean4-hash)), the proved
SHA-256 every gate computes digests with, and `effects`
([lean4-effects](https://github.com/pure-algebra/lean4-effects)), the generic
effect algebra the Stratum S packets build against from P4. Every proof receipt in this
repository is stated against that kernel. Everything below runs from any directory inside the
checkout.

```text
lake build                       # libraries, the elaboration-time axiom gate, the gate executables
lake exe vendorseal              # vendor/ against generated/vendor-manifest.tsv, both directions
lake exe citations               # no line-numbered citation into a protected authored document
lake exe urlinventory            # generated/url-source-inventory.tsv against a regeneration from the sealed URL source
lake exe urlcensus               # the authored URL census and its source assignments against a regeneration
lake exe census                  # the Streams census and coverage emit; --standard infra for the Infra census
```

Every gate is Lean. Shell files, where they exist, only orchestrate.

`lake exe trustselftest` (not a default target, not in CI) plants known
violations in a throwaway copy and checks that the axiom gate rejects each;
run it after changing the gate itself. The WP-7 rename-parity receipt was
retired on 2026-09-03: it had proved what it was written to prove.

## Where to start

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) routes all work in this repository.
- [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) owns the phases, their exit gates, and the current phase.
- [`SPEC-MANIFEST.md`](SPEC-MANIFEST.md) owns the authority pins and the
  section-by-section dispositions of the specification.
- [`docs/DESIGN-BASIS.md`](docs/DESIGN-BASIS.md) records the adopted
  architecture and the role of each primary source, including EffHOL.
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) owns module boundaries.
- [`docs/PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PROVENANCE.md) records every pin with its
  digest, fetch command, and cross-check.
- [`docs/HASH-PACKAGE-PLAN.md`](docs/HASH-PACKAGE-PLAN.md) records the
  extraction of the SHA-256 lane and foldlab's SHA3-512 into lean4-hash, the
  shared proved hash library this repository now depends on; its
  `docs/SHA256-DAG.md` is the proof graph.
- [`docs/REIFICATION-STRATEGY.md`](docs/REIFICATION-STRATEGY.md) is the
  draft cross-standard design: three strata of one effects algebra, the
  specification dependency graph as a handler tower, two realizers per
  signature. A living document under refinement.
- [`docs/research/README.md`](docs/research/README.md) indexes the research
  passes and the findings decisions rest on.

## Process

This repository follows the breaker/builder discipline developed in
[lean4-effect4](https://github.com/mepuka/lean4-effect4): a contract packet
and red battery are frozen by a separate process before any implementation,
every declaration-changing counterexample receives a stable ID, every
semantic owner closes a ten-edge proof graph, and no claim uses the words
"sound", "equivalent", "preserves", or "complete" without naming the exact
judgment, observation mask, theorem, assumptions, and remaining host boundary.
