# Specification manifest

This file owns the authority pins, the authority order, and the
section-by-section dispositions of the WHATWG Streams Standard for this
repository, and, since slice W5 of `docs/WHATWG-PACKAGE-PLAN.md`, the
authority pins of the Infra, HTML, and URL Standards. The original disposition
tables and coverage report are Streams-scoped; the URL bootstrap survey below
is separate. Its reviewed source census is projected by `lake exe urlcensus`;
the declaration/numerator join and URL coverage denominator remain unadmitted.
`docs/PROVENANCE.md` owns the fetch record and cross-check of
every digest quoted here; `generated/vendor-manifest.tsv` owns the per-file
digests of the vendored bytes.

Status: P0 pins frozen, 2026-09-01. Dispositions below are the P0 survey;
from P1 the generated census owns every row and this table becomes its
authored input.

The vendored trees are byte-identical to upstream at those commits. Nothing
under `vendor/` is edited; re-pinning moves a whole tree together.

## Authority order

1. Each standard's source at its pin (`index.bs` for Streams, `url.bs` for
   URL). Where it states an algorithm, the model is that
   algorithm. Where it states requirements, the model is that specification,
   and any algorithm is a candidate realizer.
2. A separately identified implementation, where pinned. Evidence, never
   authority. No URL implementation is admitted by the bootstrap.
3. WPT. Host conformance, never authority.
4. Local host profiles, then published browser results by run identifier.

## Disposition vocabulary

Every census row receives exactly one disposition.

| Disposition | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `owned` | modelled in Lean; must carry at least one witness before its coverage row can leave `absent` |
| `requirement` | stated as constraints rather than an algorithm (piping); modelled as a specification φ, realized by a named algorithm |
| `foreignBoundary` | a host-supplied body or host object whose behaviour enters only as typed decisions with a profile: underlying source, sink, and transformer methods; ArrayBuffer detachment; `AbortSignal` |
| `hostOnly` | Web IDL conversions, brand checks, and constructor overload resolution; enforced by the host's IDL layer, recorded as refusals at the boundary |
| `refused` | transferable streams and their `MessagePort` protocol; a refusal theorem states they are outside the model |
| `evidenceOnly` | examples, introductions, and the "other specifications" section; never counted in the denominator |
| `targetOnly` | rows that exist only for the P11 TypeScript profile |

## Section dispositions (P0 survey of `index.bs`)

The survey counted 248 algorithm-block openers beginning `<div algorithm`,
of which 229 are the bare `<div algorithm>` and 19 carry attributes, and
about 8,400 lines (the earlier figure of 7,041 was a non-blank line count).
The survey's "66 distinct internal slot names" was an overcount of four:
`[[FETCH]]`, `[[COMPRESSION]]`, `[[ENCODING]]`, and `[[WEBSOCKETS]]` are
Bikeshed bibliography citations that never occur in the escaped or
autolinked slot spelling (verified by the coordinator at P1 landing); the
census carries 62 `slot` rows. The P1 census keys on the `<div algorithm`
prefix, not the closing bracket, which is what keeps those 19 blocks. From
P1 the generated census owns every count. After P1.1: 248 `op`, 133 `idl`
across 20 IDL blocks (including six `typedef`, `enum`, and `includes`
statements), 62 `slot`, 7 `requirement`, denominator 410 with 40 excluded.
Do not quote these as coverage.

| Section id | Title | Disposition | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `intro`, `model`, `conventions` | introduction, model, conventions | `evidenceOnly` (the model section is a reading aid for masks and backpressure) | — |
| `rs-class` | `ReadableStream` class | `owned`; IDL members `hostOnly` at the boundary | P4 |
| `generic-reader-mixin`, `default-reader-class` | reader mixin, default reader | `owned` | P4 |
| `byob-reader-class`, `rbs-controller-class`, `rs-byob-request-class` | BYOB reader, byte controller, BYOB request | `owned`, separate calculus; ArrayBuffer detach `foreignBoundary` | P9 |
| `rs-default-controller-class` | default controller | `owned` | P4 |
| `rs-all-abstract-ops` | readable abstract operations | `owned`; tee is P4-late; byte ops P9 | P4 / P9 |
| `ws-class`, `default-writer-class`, `ws-default-controller-class`, `ws-all-abstract-ops` | writable stream, writer, controller, abstract operations | `owned` | P5 |
| `ts-class`, `ts-default-controller-class`, `ts-all-abstract-ops` | transform stream, controller, abstract operations | `owned` | P6 |
| `pipe-chains` (model) and `ReadableStreamPipeTo` | piping requirements and the reference algorithm | `requirement` realized by the reference algorithm | P7 |
| `qs-api`, `blqs-class`, `cqs-class`, `qs-abstract-ops` | queuing strategies | `owned` | P3 |
| `queue-with-sizes` | queue-with-sizes | `owned` | P3 |
| `transferrable-streams` | transferable streams | `refused` | — |
| `misc-abstract-ops` | miscellaneous abstract operations | `owned` where used; `hostOnly` for IDL helpers | P3–P7 as consumed |
| `other-specs` | using streams in other specifications | `evidenceOnly` | — |
| `creating-examples`, `acks` | examples, acknowledgments | `evidenceOnly` | — |

Underlying source, sink, and transformer dictionaries (`UnderlyingSource`,
`UnderlyingSink`, `Transformer`) are `foreignBoundary`: their `start`,
`pull`, `cancel`, `write`, `close`, `abort`, `transform`, and `flush` members
are named operations whose invocations are decisions, with the spec's
"if it throws" and "wait for the promise" clauses modelled as answer kinds.

## URL section dispositions (U0 bootstrap survey of `url.bs`)

This survey routes future packets; it is not a generated census or a coverage
claim. U2 of `docs/URL-PACKAGE-PLAN.md` must inventory definitions, algorithms,
parser states, record components, IDL members, validation errors, and prose
requirements by byte span before semantic implementation. Each row then gets
one disposition, including explicit dependency and boundary decisions.

| Section id | Bootstrap disposition and boundary | Planned slice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `goals` | goals requiring named laws in future packets; explanatory text `evidenceOnly` | U2 |
| `infrastructure`, `writing`, `parsers`, `percent-encoded-bytes` | URL-owned helpers and validation-error behavior `owned`; Infra carriers retain their canonical owner; Encoding calls need dependency records | U3 |
| `security-considerations` | security recommendations inventoried separately from executable algorithms; normative constraints `requirement` | U2 |
| `hosts-(domains-and-ip-addresses)`, `host-representation`, `host-miscellaneous`, `host-writing`, `host-parsing`, `host-serializing`, `host-equivalence` | `owned`; domain processing links to the IDNA dependency below | U4 |
| `idna` | URL's invocation parameters and error handling `owned`; Unicode UTS #46 processing and tables need their own exact pin and assurance route | U4 |
| `urls`, `url-representation`, `url-miscellaneous`, `url-writing`, `url-parsing`, `url-serializing`, `url-equivalence` | `owned`; record and parser-state contracts distinguish validation errors from failure, and null from empty components | U5 |
| `origin` | URL algorithm `owned`; HTML origin values and File API blob URL entries require named dependency/boundary records | U6 |
| `url-rendering`, `url-rendering-simplification`, `url-rendering-elision`, `url-rendering-i18n` | `requirement` where the text constrains presentation; explanatory examples `evidenceOnly`; keep separate from serialization | U6 |
| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `urlencoded-parsing`, `urlencoded-serializing`, `urlencoded-hooks` | `owned`; Encoding dependency must account for UTF-8 and any supported legacy encoder | U7 |
| `api`, `url-class`, `interface-urlsearchparams` | URL and URLSearchParams algorithms, mutation and association `owned`; Web IDL conversions and host identity need explicit boundary records | U8 |
| `url-apis-elsewhere` | cross-standard requirements inventoried at U2; dependency obligations follow their named owner | U8 |
| `acknowledgments` | `evidenceOnly` | — |

The host miscellaneous algorithms also reference Public Suffix List data;
URL-writing requirements reference the IANA URI Schemes registry, and
rendering references Unicode bidi behavior. Their external authority and
data/version boundaries require explicit U2 rows as well.

No missing dependency is silently replaced by a host call. U2 must decide
and record whether each imported algorithm is a proved dependency, a URL-owned
adapter, or an explicit profiled boundary. Such a boundary limits the eventual
claim and cannot count as a proof of that external standard.

## Promise and job model (Streams)

The specification is written over ECMAScript promises. Promise-job order is
deterministic under ECMAScript's FIFO job queue, so the job queue is state in
the configuration, not a decision kind. The only decisions are consumer calls,
foreign-boundary answers with their settlement timing, and abort signals. This
is a P0 ruling recorded in `docs/DESIGN-BASIS.md`; P8 tests it against WPT
ordering cases under mask M2.

## Rulings made at P1 landing (2026-09-02)

- ECMAScript promise and completion-record internals (`[[PromiseState]]`,
  `[[PromiseIsHandled]]`, `[[Value]]`) are `foreignBoundary`: they are host
  runtime objects the representation rules exclude from stored content; the
  job queue that settles them is state (DB-03).
- ArrayBuffer and ArrayBufferView internals read by the byte-stream
  algorithms are `foreignBoundary`, consistent with ArrayBuffer detachment.
- The `*-transfer` subsections of the three stream classes are `refused`
  with their two slots; `[[Detached]]` on `ReadableStream`, which exists
  only for that protocol, is `refused` too, by authored override (landed at
  P1.1).
- The three underlying-source, underlying-sink, and transformer dictionaries
  and their members are `foreignBoundary`; every other IDL member is
  `hostOnly` at the boundary.
- `ReadableStreamPipeTo` itself carries disposition `requirement` as the
  reference realizer of the seven piping requirements.
- `typedef`, `enum`, and `includes` statements in the IDL blocks (six at the
  pin) receive `idl` rows with disposition `hostOnly` (landed at P1.1). Two
  of them, the `ReadableStreamController` union typedef and the
  `ReadableStreamType` enum, sit inside the `underlying-source-api` IDL
  block whose section is `foreignBoundary`; they are Web IDL type
  declarations, not dictionary members with host-supplied bodies, so they
  are `hostOnly` by authored override. Ratified by the coordinator at the
  P2 landing, 2026-09-02.

## Open rows

- `ReadableStreamTee` and the async-iteration protocol are `owned` but are
  scheduled after the P4 representative closes.
- `AbortSignal` interaction in piping is `foreignBoundary` with a profile
  fixed at P7.
