# Whatwg.Html.Node.Combinators

One combinator per element constructor of `Html_sigs.T` (111 of them, in
`html_sigs.mli` order), the two text constructors, and one helper per
attribute constructor (216 of them). Slice H3.4 of
`docs/HTML-PACKAGE-PLAN.md`.

PRODUCED FROM `Whatwg.Html.Schema.elements` and
`Whatwg.Html.Schema.attributeCtors` at H3 by a hand-run script, then edited by
hand for the labelled forms of `html_sigs.mli`. It is not drift-checked, and
since 2026-09-06 neither is `Whatwg/Html/Schema/**`, which is authored source.
A schema change therefore has to be reflected here by hand, and the shape
check that catches an omission is that the tests in
`WhatwgTest/Html/Builders.lean` stop elaborating.

## Shape

Names are TyXML's OCaml value names (`object_`, `output_elt`, `tablex`), with
`section` and `meta` in guillemets because they collide with Lean tokens.
They live in `Whatwg.Html.E` and `Whatwg.Html.A` rather than in
`Whatwg.Html`, because a dozen of them are single letters (`a`, `b`, `i`,
`p`, `q`, `s`, `u`) that would otherwise shadow ordinary variable names at
every use site of the library.

Argument order departs from the sketch in the slice brief: children come
first and `attrs` second with a default of `[]`. OCaml's `?a:` is a labelled
optional argument, which Lean has no direct analogue for; putting the
attributes last keeps `div [txt "x"]` working positionally, and
`div [txt "x"] [A.a_class "lead"]` and `div (attrs := [A.a_id "x"]) []` both
read the way TyXML's `div ~a:[...] [...]` does. Required labelled arguments
of `html_sigs.mli` (`img ~src ~alt`, `link ~rel ~href`, `area ~alt`,
`bdo ~dir`, `optgroup ~label`, `command ~label`, `picture ~img`,
`details summary`, `html head body`, `head title`) are explicit leading
arguments; optional labelled arguments (`figure ?figcaption`,
`table ?caption ?columns ?thead ?tfoot`, `fieldset ?legend`,
`object_ ?params`, `audio/video ?src ?srcs`) are optional arguments after the
children.

## What was simplified

- `figure ?figcaption` is `` `Top `` only: TyXML's `` `Bottom `` placement is
  not expressible through a single `Option`.
- `datalist ?children` and `menu ?children` are dropped. Both are `nullary`
  rows in the projection whose TyXML signature carries an optional variant of
  two child shapes (`` `Options ``/`` `Phras ``, `` `Lis ``/`` `Flows ``);
  modelling that needs a sum whose two arms carry different content sets, and
  the element's own content set in the projection is `notag`, so a faithful
  version would have to sit outside the `Element t inner` shape. The two
  combinators here take attributes and no children.
- `svg` takes neither children nor an attribute obligation (ruling HP-9).
- Attribute values are `String`; TyXML's typed value constructors are a later
  slice. The two prefixed constructors, `a_user_data` (`data-`) and `a_aria`
  (`aria-`), therefore lose their name suffix, because `Attr × String` has no
  room for it.
- `noscript` is not polymorphic in `inner`. Its element row is not
  transparent and TyXML's own `val noscript` is not polymorphic either, but
  `ContentSet.transparentPayload` does assign it a payload, so a `noscript`
  can be placed only where that payload is its own content set
  `flow5_without_noscript` — in a phrasing context the payload is
  `phrasing_without_noscript` and `Child.of` will reject it. That is TyXML's
  signature reproduced, and the mismatch between the two notions of
  transparency is the theorem `transparent_eq_isTransparent_or_four` of
  `Whatwg.Html.Content.Transparent`.
