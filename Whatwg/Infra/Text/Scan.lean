# Text.Scan

Owner: the position-variable algorithms of section `strings` of
`vendor/whatwg-infra-3f984adc/infra.bs`: collect a sequence of code points,
skip ASCII whitespace, strictly split, split on ASCII whitespace, split on
commas, and concatenate.

The text's "position variable … tracking the position of the calling
algorithm within input" is modelled explicitly as a `Nat` index into the
code point view of the input. `collect` returns both the collected code
points and the updated position, exactly as the note says it "updates the
position variable in the calling algorithm", and each split threads that
position through its loop the same way.

The split loops are "while position is not past the end of input". Every
iteration advances the position by at least one, so the remaining length
`input.length - position` at loop entry bounds the iteration count; that
remaining length is the fuel each loop recurses on, which keeps every loop
total without a separate termination argument.

/-- Collect a sequence of code points meeting a condition from `input`
given a position variable, section `strings`: "While position doesn't point
past the end of input and the code point at position within input meets the
condition condition: append that code point to the end of result; advance
position by 1. Return result." The returned pair is the result and the
updated position: "in addition to returning the collected code points, this
algorithm updates the position variable in the calling algorithm". -/

`strings`: "collect a sequence of code points that are ASCII whitespace from
input given position. The collected code points are not used, but position
is still updated." Returns the updated position. -/

past the end of input: Assert: the code point at position within input is
delimiter. Advance position by 1. Let token be the result of collecting a
sequence of code points that are not equal to delimiter from input, given
position. Append token to tokens." The assertion holds because the previous
collect stopped only at a code point equal to `delimiter`; it is discharged
by that invariant, not checked. Fuel: the remaining length at entry. -/

leading and trailing ASCII whitespace from token. Append token to tokens. If
position is not past the end of input: Assert: the code point at position
within input is U+002C (,). Advance position by 1." The note "token might be
the empty string" is why an empty token is appended unconditionally. The
assertion holds because collect stopped only at a comma. Fuel: the
remaining length at entry. -/

each other by separator." -/
