# Text.Whitespace

Owner: the four newline and ASCII whitespace rewrites of section `strings`
of `vendor/whatwg-infra-3f984adc/infra.bs`: strip newlines, normalize
newlines, strip leading and trailing ASCII whitespace, and strip and collapse
ASCII whitespace.

Each operation is stated by the text on code points, so each is defined on
the code point view: `codePoints s`, the transform on `List CodePoint` (held
in `namespace CodePoints`), then `ofCodePoints`. The `JsString` operations
are those compositions.

Normalize newlines follows ruling INFRA-R4 (`docs/INFRA-PROOF-PLAN.md`
section 3): a single left-to-right non-overlapping pass replacing CR LF by
LF, followed by replacing every remaining CR by LF. On CR CR LF this yields
LF LF, of length 2, the discriminating case against an iterate-to-fixed-point
reading, which would yield a single LF.

/-- The first step of normalize newlines, section `strings`: "replace every
U+000D CR U+000A LF code point pair with a single U+000A LF code point". One
left-to-right non-overlapping pass (ruling INFRA-R4): a CR followed by LF
becomes LF and both are consumed; any other code point is kept. -/

and then replace every remaining U+000D CR code point with a U+000A LF code
point". The two steps are sequenced, not iterated (ruling INFRA-R4), so on
CR CR LF the result is LF LF, of length 2. -/

`strings`: "replace any sequence of one or more consecutive code points that
are ASCII whitespace in the string with a single U+0020 SPACE code point".
The flag records whether the previous code point was ASCII whitespace, so
the first code point of a run emits the SPACE and the rest of the run emits
nothing. -/
