# WHATWG Streams reification plan

Status: P0 bootstrap complete, 2026-09-01. Held before P1 for the R0 research
pass.

## Objective

Reify the WHATWG Streams Standard in Lean 4: every abstract operation,
internal slot, IDL member, and stated requirement of the pinned specification
becomes first-order Lean data with proved laws; execution meaning is a
relation over configurations and explicit decisions; an EffHOL-style logic
layer sits above the semantics; the piping requirements are realized by the
reference algorithm as a theorem; and a closed combinator alphabet lowers to
checked TypeScript. Host conformance is measured, never assumed.

## Non-negotiable semantic boundaries

- The specification text is the authority; hosts are evidence
  (`AGENTS.md` "Authority order").
- Authored stream programs and combinators are first-order, finite, versioned
  data.
- Underlying source, sink, and transformer bodies are foreign boundaries with
  profiles; their answers are decisions on the tape.
- Full execution meaning is a relation over configurations, decisions, and
  observations. A fixed compatible tape yields one replay path.
- Every theorem names its observation mask: M1 (chunk sequence plus terminal
  outcome) or M2 (full settlement order).
- Live frontiers are distinct from typed failure, cancellation, abort, and
  refusal.
- Byte streams arrive as their own calculus (P9); transferable streams are
  refused, never modelled.
- TypeScript tooling and runtime observations are evidence targets; Lean owns
  the model and theorem statements.
- Every gate is Lean.

## Ratified decisions (operator, 2026-09-01)

1. Public repository `mepuka/lean4-WHATWG-streams`, default branch `main`.
2. Gates are implemented in Lean; shell only orchestrates.
3. Observation masks M1 and M2 are pre-registered; every theorem names one.
4. Byte streams are deferred to P9; transferable streams are a refusal.
5. Vendored material is retained with its upstream licenses; the reference
   implementation's dual CC0 / MIT license was verified at P0.

## Phase gates

| Phase | Deliverable | Exit gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 — bootstrap | independent Lake package, exact toolchain, six routers, sealed pins, Lean gates, CI, provenance | `lake build` green; all four gate executables green; pins cross-checked |
| R0 — research hold | implementation-strategy and performance notes for the Lean standard library, and the accumulated text-processing benchmarks from `pure-algebra/lean4-nlp`, written up as an authored design input | notes landed under `docs/research/`; the P1 census generator's representation decisions cite them |
| P1 — inventory | census generator over `index.bs`: one row per abstract operation, internal slot, IDL member, and stated requirement, anchored by span digest; every row classified | every row has one disposition; the census join gate is green; missing rows fail cutover |
| P2 — breadth scaffold | empty modules for every category, central contracts and counterexample registers, generated assurance schema | no semantic declarations; scaffold build and declaration scan green |
| P3 — queue-with-sizes and queuing strategies | the first representative: total, kernel-reducible operations with their invariants | breaker battery green; laws proved; axiom receipts recorded |
| P4 — readable default path | `ReadableStream` state machine, default controller, default reader | representative contract closed; counterexamples registered |
| P5 — writable | `WritableStream`, its controller and writer, the erroring state and in-flight bookkeeping | representative contract closed |
| P6 — transform | `TransformStream`, its controller, backpressure coupling | representative contract closed |
| P7 — piping | the piping requirements as a specification; the reference `ReadableStreamPipeTo` as a realizer; relational semantics of shutdown | realizability theorem stated and proved under a named mask |
| P8 — configuration and WPT replay | promise-job queue in the configuration, masks as declared projections, bounded runner, WPT replay harness against the three local host profiles | harness green at exact pins; host-profile refusal rows recorded |
| P9 — byte streams | `ReadableByteStreamController`, BYOB reader and request, ArrayBuffer detachment as a foreign boundary | separate calculus with explicit embedding rows |
| P10 — logic | `wlp`, totality, the `wp` decomposition theorem, EffHOL modality instance | decomposition theorem proved for the chosen semantics |
| P11 — targets | closed combinator alphabet, typed TypeScript IR, lowering, render, host harness | typing and simulation proofs; deterministic bytes; exact coverage |
| P12 — bridges | Node legacy streams calculus, Effect Channel embedding (cross-repository) | each bridge names its loss and its mask |
| S1 — SHA-256 proof lane (landed; moved to lean4-hash at step 6, 2026-09-02) | the three-layer `Spec`/`Impl`/`Fast` SHA-256 with the `Impl = Spec` refinement and the pointwise `Fast = Impl` bridge, a `Digest`/`Hex` API, root split so consumers never pay for kernel known-answer tests, a typed audit line, streaming, and SHA-224, in stages S1.0–S1.7 per `docs/SHA256-DAG.md` | every edge of `SHA256-PG-IMPL-EQ-SPEC` closed; `Gates` consumes `Sha256.sha256` and regenerates `generated/vendor-manifest.tsv` byte-identically; `leanchecker --fresh`, dual-host, and lean4lean receipts recorded |

S1 is independent of P1 through P12 and may run beside any of them. Its
staging, built-ins ledger, do-not-use list, stop conditions, report shape,
budgets, and rulings follow foldlab's fips202 library specification
(`.staging/fips202-library/SPEC.md`, decision 45), adapted to 32-bit words
and to this repository's stricter semantic ceiling. Until S1 closes, the
vendor seal's digests are executable evidence cross-checked against a second
implementation at pin time, and `docs/PROVENANCE.md` says so.

## Broad-before-deep representatives

Before deep work, freeze one representative contract in each group:

1. data: queue-with-sizes with `EnqueueValueWithSize` and `DequeueValue`;
2. readable: one default-controller enqueue/pull/close lifecycle;
3. writable: one write/close with backpressure;
4. transform: one transform with backpressure propagation;
5. piping: one pipe with error propagation and shutdown;
6. configuration: one promise-settlement ordering case from WPT;
7. logic: one `wlp` judgment over a stream program;
8. target: one generated combinator checked by the TypeScript compiler;
9. bridge: one Node legacy stream related in both directions.

## Dependency policy

Lean core and Std are the default substrate. A third-party Lean dependency is
added only after an exact-pin acceptance probe shows that it builds on the
pinned Lean version, has acceptable licensing and transitive cost, supplies a
materially deeper public abstraction, and does not force the library's
representation to narrow accidentally. Borrowed API ideas are credited even
when their implementation is not imported.

## Current phase

**Current phase, 2026-09-05:** P3 is landed. P4a's default-readable
representative is implemented against the independently frozen packet
`f4394d81d59739dd1410c6cc16df17ee147d6e1f`: 204 exact ascriptions, 94 theorem
obligations, and 17 retained finite witnesses pass. `docs/READABLE-DAG.md`
owns its landing receipt and remaining assurance edges. This is one attached
default reader after successful start, with staged size and pull callbacks,
local M1/M2 observations, and finite external-step composition. Full P4 is
still open: lifecycle, cancellation, global scheduling, reachable-state and
freshness invariants, full-state/host embeddings, and the clause-level
coverage join remain required work.

P5a's fixed attached writer representative is implemented against base
`68fc922` (integrated as `5669062`), lifecycle addendum `b4f8642` (`47a86da`),
and exact in-flight addendum `15d198c` (`5f7cebe`). Its 162 interface entries,
109 local laws, two composed lifecycle proofs, and retained finite witnesses
pass the 72-job narrow build; the default build passes 275 jobs. All 111
named theorem receipts and the exhaustive root audit pass under R-11.
`docs/WRITABLE-DAG.md` owns the exact landing commands and scope. Full P5
remains open for setup/start, writer acquisition/release, reachable-state and
freshness invariants, global scheduling and promise embeddings, DB-04 mask
relations, and the clause-level coverage join.

P6a transform/backpressure coupling is implemented against the independent
`03547f1feb938d65898c47b4061faeb3f4bd9edf` packet, integrated as `5d95212`
after P5a `e4d053a`; the two elaboration annotations are recorded at
`e668767`. All 112 interface entries, 115 local laws, three composed runs
through actual P4/P5 states, and fourteen retained witnesses pass the
71-job narrow build. The default build passes 287 jobs; all 118 theorem
receipts and the exhaustive root audit pass under R-11. The known-red set
is empty. `docs/TRANSFORM-DAG.md` owns the landing commands, four finite Node
observations and scope. Full P6 remains open for setup/start, arbitrary
output sizing, flush/cancel/close/abort, reachable-state and shared-identity
invariants, global scheduling, full-state/host and DB-04 embeddings, and the
clause-level coverage join.

P7a forward-error shutdown is implemented against independent packet
`2f4318337b839de1cce5d12e5c1f31e594dc6222`, integrated as `ea03725` after
P6a `afb57f8`. All 98 interface entries, 44 requirements/stage laws, two
composed runs, 46 production receipts and sixteen retained finite witnesses
pass the 75-job narrow build. The known-red set is empty. The quantified
`forwardShutdown_realizes` proves `ForwardShutdownSpec` under
`observeShutdown` for every admitted finite candidate run, using independently
established read inventory, returned-promise references and phase invariants.
The two composed proofs establish actual P4 enqueue/read prefixes and P5
write/drain/abort paths with exact reason precedence. The endpoint is a
request to finalize; canonical release, pipe-promise settlement, progress,
full lifecycle, global M1/M2 and the clause-level coverage join remain open.
`docs/PIPING-DAG.md` owns the landing receipt and remaining graph obligations.

**Operator hold, 2026-09-05:** further semantics formalization is deferred
until there are more consumers. The current action is final review and
submission of the existing work for approval, without extending its scope.
P8a configuration ordering is not admitted for implementation. Its separate
`codex/configuration-breaker` worktree retains explicitly unfrozen and
unverified drafts for one actual writable root, observer registrations and
a global FIFO of job references; that draft is excluded from the submission.
Resumption requires a consumer-driven scope decision and the independent
breaker freeze. The identity, FIFO, effect-order, replay, progress and
independent source-prefix obligations remain open. The breadth-before-depth
rule still applies on resumption. Full P4–P12 remain open.

The package also contains HTML H1–H4 and the Infra text implementations
introduced by `c610a5e`. Earlier empty/uncommitted descriptions below are
historical. The following integration receipt landed at `319e744`.

The Infra merge broke the existing Streams coverage caller and introduced
unelaborated codec and ordering definitions. The integration slice repaired
those failures without widening their public signatures, imported the Infra
modules into the audited root, and connected the definition census to CI.
Infra's generated row list has no claimed theorem witnesses; its semantic
proof packets and assurance records remain open. The hash configuration is
restored to the exact `0168306` pin already carried by the manifest and
provenance after the configured `2447edd` revision could not be fetched.
The full reification still requires P4–P12 and the breadth contracts listed
above; neither this integration slice nor the HTML work closes those phases.

Integration verification, 2026-09-05: `lake --log-level=warning build`
passed all 247 jobs. The root's axiom gate checked 113 modules and 6540
declarations under R-11; the six `WS-INFRA-CE-001` finite probes reach only
`propext`, `Quot.sound`, and `Classical.choice`. The built vendor seal,
citations, TyXML schema, Streams census/report, and Infra census executables
all passed. An independent read-only review checked the source corrections,
dispositions, generated assurance wording, and residual proof scope. Infra's
text graph and full Streams P4–P12 remain open; these integration receipts
do not add a semantic coverage witness.

**URL work, 2026-09-05:** `docs/URL-PACKAGE-PLAN.md` owns the URL lane,
starting from `main` at `c1c7caa` on `codex/url-reification`. U0/U1 fetch
and seal the URL source and WPT URL corpus and establish the declaration-free
`Whatwg.Url` root. The requested end state is URL reification with verified
algorithms, laws, and explicit dependency boundaries; the bootstrap is its
first slice. U2a now checks the lexical source inventory under
`lake exe urlinventory`; U2 semantic classification and proof obligations
remain open in `docs/URL-CENSUS-DAG.md`. Streams phases and their coverage
remain scoped as before.

P0 is complete. The package is an independent Lean 4.33.1 package with no
dependencies. The six routers exist. The specification source, its reference
implementation, and the WPT `streams/` directory are vendored at exact
commits and sealed by a Lean-checked manifest. The four Lean gate executables
and the elaboration-time axiom gate are green. Every pin has a digest recorded
in `docs/PROVENANCE.md`, cross-checked between the proved SHA-256 (now the
required `hash` package) and a second implementation.

R0 is complete: all three documents are landed under `docs/research/` with
their decision-bearing findings in `docs/research/README.md`.

**P1 merged into `main` 2026-09-02** (`72b1bfd`), and **P1.1 and P2 landed
2026-09-02**, all reviewed and re-gated by the coordinator. The census
stands at 450 rows (248 `op`, 133 `idl`, 62 `slot`, 7 `requirement`),
denominator 410; the coverage block reads `denominator 410;
owned-with-green 0/410; green 0, partial 0, absent 410; census 450 rows, 40
excluded`. P2 placed 52 declaration-free breadth stubs under
`Whatwg/Streams/`, one per area and named sub-area of the architecture
table, every one reachable from the root and audited (78 modules). Lane S1
landed the same day (`a8f08d0`): every digest the repository pins is
computed by the proved SHA-256, since W3 the required `hash` package. The RS-D1 algebra package is planned in
`docs/ALGEBRA-PACKAGE-PLAN.md` and held until the operator's incoming
lean4-effect4 work lands.

**Landed 2026-09-02:** S1.5–S1.7 (merge `a1383bc`: streaming `Context`
with the buffered-update law, SHA-224 proved end to end, lean4lean stopped
at its own toolchain gate) and the P3 breaker (merge of `p3/queue-breaker`:
72 frozen ascriptions, 99 theorems red, 44 green witnesses, `DATA-PG-QUEUE`).
`P3-R1` is ruled in `docs/DATA-DAG.md`: an exact size carrier with binary64
rounding as a foreign boundary. Main is deliberately red on the two declared
battery modules until the P3 builder lands; the trust self-test is the
deciding gate meanwhile and CI builds the production targets.

**`[[require]] effects` taken 2026-09-02 (slice W4 of `docs/WHATWG-PACKAGE-PLAN.md`, ruling WP-5), acceptance probe under the dependency policy below:** exact pin `5611c3a3cd4cd4b830c76d6c25c7dba6034c973a` (tag `v0.1.0`); license at that commit Apache-2.0 (MIT on the package's `main` since the same day); transitive cost zero (its manifest lists no packages); toolchain identical (`leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`); `lake build effects/Effects` elaborates under this toolchain; the algebra is a materially deeper public abstraction by the family ruling (every standard builds against it) and fixes no result universe or first-order representation here, since nothing imports it until P4. Its parity receipt against lean4-effect4 `217d3e4` is in that package.

**The algebra dependency is settled by the operator on the Mac:**
`pure-algebra/lean4-effects` v0.1.0 (commit `5611c3a`) is the standalone
`Effects.Algebra` package, already required by lean4-effect4 at that
commit; its README names WHATWG Streams as the first web-standard
reification built against it. RS-D1 and `docs/ALGEBRA-PACKAGE-PLAN.md` are
therefore superseded. This repository takes `[[require]] effects` when the
first Stratum S packet (P4) opens; P3 is Stratum V data and needs nothing
from it.

**P3 landed 2026-09-02:** the builder proved all 99 frozen theorems with zero battery edits (447 declarations from the two fenced modules, 375 axiom-free, 2 at `[propext, Quot.sound]`), the coordinator allocated the ruled `P3-R1` instance to `Whatwg/Streams/Data/DyadicSize.lean`, the known-red set is empty again, and every gate is green. The first breaker-then-builder packet of the streams calculi is closed; `DATA-PG-QUEUE` has every applicable edge closed. The coverage numerator packet landed 2026-09-02: the block reads `denominator 410; owned-with-green 12/410; green 12, partial 6, absent 392; census 450 rows, 40 excluded`, printed from the Lean emit and refused on any disagreement. **Reorganization (operator, 2026-09-02):** `lean4-hash` finished at `0168306`. This repository becomes the single `whatwg` package, one library per standard, per `docs/WHATWG-PACKAGE-PLAN.md`; hash step 6 landed as its slice W3 (`[[require]] hash` at `0168306`; the vendor manifest regenerated byte-identically through `Hash.Sha256.sha256`; the `Sha256/` tree, its audit root, executable, contract, and counterexamples left) and the effects require is its slice W4. P4 and foldlab step 7 wait for W5.

**Operator direction 2026-09-02: the SHA-256 lane and foldlab's accepted
SHA3-512 library are extracted into one shared hash package that this
repository depends on.** `docs/HASH-PACKAGE-PLAN.md` owns the steps; it
runs after the S1.5–S1.7 seat lands (step 0) and lands here as the first
`[[require]]` (step 6), with byte-identical regeneration of both generated
projections as the cutover proof.

P1 was opened by the operator on the R0 evidence, delegated to
one seat in the worktree branch `p1/census` while lane S1's builder holds
the main tree. The census generator's representation decisions are fixed
by that evidence: `ByteArray` and `Nat` offsets, never `String` positions;
fuel-bounded scanning; rows keyed on the `<div algorithm` opener prefix (248
openers, 19 with attributes); span digests through the in-tree SHA-256;
`decide +kernel` for any kernel check; `Std.HashMap` allowed, `Std.TreeMap`
and `Lean.Json` not. Exit gate unchanged: every row has one disposition, the
census join gate is green in both directions, and a byte-for-byte drift gate
regenerates the census into a clean tree. Lane S1 runs beside P1.

## Near-term proof burden

| Order | Owner | Assurance route | Required work before advancing |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | R0 research | authored design input | land `docs/research/` notes; decide the `index.bs` parsing representation and the byte-span digest strategy from measured data |
| 1 | P1 census generator | generated projection with drift gate | one row per algorithm, slot, IDL member, requirement; anchors occur exactly once; span digests computed by the in-tree SHA-256 |
| 2 | P2 scaffold | none (no declarations) | every category module exists and is reached by the default build |
| 3 | P3 queue-with-sizes | proof graph `DATA-PG-QUEUE` | breaker packet frozen red; builder closes construction, laws, counterexamples, trust |
| S1 | SHA-256 | proof graph `SHA256-PG-IMPL-EQ-SPEC` | **S1.1–S1.4 landed 2026-09-02 (`a8f08d0`)**: `Impl = Spec` and `Fast = Impl` proved at the semantic ceiling, manifest regenerated through the proved library. Open: S1.5 streaming, S1.6 SHA-224, S1.7 dual-host and lean4lean; the trust edge stays open until S1.7 |
