# Provenance

Every pin this repository relies on, with its digest, how it was fetched, the
cross-check performed, and its license. `SPEC-MANIFEST.md` owns what each pin
is for; this file owns that the bytes are what they are claimed to be.

Digest cross-check protocol: every digest is computed by `lake exe vendorseal`
through the required `hash` package (`Hash.Sha256.sha256`, proved against
FIPS 180-4 in lean4-hash) and independently by PowerShell `Get-FileHash
-Algorithm SHA256`; both spellings must agree. At P0 the first computation was
the in-tree `lake exe sha256`, executable evidence until the lane's proof
graph closed; at the swap to the package (step 6 of
`docs/HASH-PACKAGE-PLAN.md`) `generated/vendor-manifest.tsv` regenerated
byte-identically, so every digest below is unchanged.

The TyXML schema projection `generated/tyxml-html-schema.tsv` is generated by
`lake exe tyxmlschema` from the three sealed inputs it names in its header,
refusing any other digest. Cross-check at the pin (2026-09-03): an
independent reading of `html_types.mli` and `html_sigs.mli` through OCaml
4.14.2's own parser (`compiler-libs`, `scripts/tyxml-schema-crosscheck.ml`)
lists 931 declarations as (kind, line, module path, name); the projection's
`type` and `val` rows project to the identical 931 lines in the same order
(`diff` empty for both files). The rendered type bodies and span digests are
the Lean reading alone.

license files are retained in place.

The NIST pins (FIPS 180-4 and the two CAVP response files) moved to
lean4-hash with the SHA-256 lane; they are works of the US Government, not
subject to copyright in the United States, and are retained unmodified there. The repository's own `LICENSE` (MIT since 2026-09-02) does not apply to
anything under `vendor/`.

`.gitattributes` disables end-of-line conversion for the whole repository
(`* -text`), so a checkout on any host reproduces the committed bytes and the
seal holds without a host-specific `core.autocrlf` setting.

**Why the blob-hash check exists.** The first P0 vendoring copied the
whatwg/streams files out of a Windows working tree, where that repository's
own `text` attributes had converted every text file to CRLF on checkout;
`git archive` applied the same conversion. The in-tree SHA-256 and
`Get-FileHash` agreed with each other on those bytes, and the seal passed,
because both were measuring the converted file. Only a comparison against
GitHub's raw content exposed the 8,401-byte difference in `index.bs`. The
vendored files were then rewritten directly from the upstream blob objects
(`git cat-file blob <sha>`), and every file in both trees is now verified
against `git ls-tree` object hashes, which cannot be affected by any
attribute or host setting. Two agreeing digests of the same wrong bytes are
not provenance; the reference point has to be upstream's own identity of the
object.

The reference implementation's `node_modules` and its own test runner
dependencies are not vendored. Running it as a host profile installs its
pinned npm dependencies outside `vendor/` (P8).

## Not vendored, digest only

FIPS 180-4 was a digest-only row until S1.0. Ruling R-8 vendored it; it is now
sealed, and its row is in "Vendored, sealed" above with the same digest.
